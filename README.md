# microglia

**A feedback data flywheel for agentic workflows, as a library.**

`microglia` turns the corrections a user makes — a re-picked chart, an edited SQL statement, a
thumbs-down with a reason — into scoped, evidenced knowledge that the same application recalls on
the next request. It ships no UI, opens no socket, and requires no service. It runs on a CPU or in a
browser.

```ts
import { openMicroglia } from '@agentix-e/microglia-core';
import { EmbeddedMemory, JsonlJournal } from '@agentix-e/microglia-core/memory';

const store = await EmbeddedMemory.open(new JsonlJournal({ dir: './.microglia' }));
const mg = await openMicroglia({ app: 'nl2charts', namespace: 'acme', store });

// 1. Before generating: recall what this workspace has already been taught.
const pack = await mg.recall({ task: 'chart.recommend', text: question, scope: { domain } });

// 2. Generate, with `pack.rendered` in the prompt. Cite `pack.ids`.
const run = mg.begin({ task: 'chart.recommend', input: { question, domain }, pack });
await run.complete(spec);

// 3. When the user changes the answer, capture the change.
await run.edit(correctedSpec);

// 4. Fold accumulated feedback into knowledge. Run it off the request path.
await mg.distill();

// 5. Next request: the pack already carries the lesson.
```

That is the whole product. Everything else is refinement.

## Why it exists

Every team that ships a generative feature ends up with the same two piles: a log of corrections
nobody reads, and a prompt that keeps making the same mistake. The feedback exists; the loop does
not. Observability platforms stop at storing the correction as a label on a trace, and memory
systems store facts without understanding that a *correction* is evidence about a *rule*.

`microglia` is the missing middle: it treats a correction as evidence, decides whether that evidence
is strong enough to steer a prompt, and forgets it when it stops being true.

| What it does | What it refuses to do |
|---|---|
| Captures ratings, edits, preferences, outcomes, clarifications | Render UI, own your HITL surface |
| Weights evidence by source trust and counts contradictions | Call a model you did not configure |
| Distills claims into scoped, deduplicated, evidenced rules | Run a server, a database, or a queue |
| Recalls a bounded, diversified prompt block | Require GPU, CUDA, or a fine-tuning loop |
| Reports why each rule is active, demoted, or retired | Send your data anywhere |

## What is in the box

| Package | Role | Runtime dependencies |
|---|---|---|
| `@agentix-e/microglia-core` | The library: domain model, store, distillation, pack construction, facade, provider contracts | none |
| `@agentix-e/microglia-node` | HTTP ingestion and recall on Hono, an MCP tool surface (`POST /v1/mcp`), DeepSeek and Zhipu providers | core, `hono` |
| `@agentix-e/microglia-browser` | Client with an offline outbox; talks to the node server | core |

`core` is the whole mechanism in one install and has **no runtime dependency**, so it bundles for the
browser unchanged. Its modules are also reachable as subpaths, which is how a host that only needs
retrieval keeps the distiller out of its bundle:

```ts
import { buildPack } from '@agentix-e/microglia-core/apply';   // retrieval only
import { EmbeddedMemory } from '@agentix-e/microglia-core/memory';
import { registerProvider } from '@agentix-e/microglia-core/providers';
```

| Subpath | Contents |
|---|---|
| `core` | `openMicroglia`, the run handle, feedback types, knowledge lifecycle |
| `core/kernel` | contracts and pure algorithms (statistics, diff, guard, similarity) |
| `core/memory` | `EmbeddedMemory`, `JsonlJournal`, lexical index, `MemoryPort` |
| `core/distill` | rule interpreter, model interpreter, generalisation |
| `core/apply` | pack construction, MMR, budget, rendering |
| `core/capture` | the facade, run handle, feedback normalisation, export, doctor |
| `core/providers` | `LlmProvider`, `EmbeddingProvider`, the registry |
| `core/delivery` | webhook events, HMAC signing, the retrying dispatcher |

## Install

```bash
pnpm add @agentix-e/microglia-core            # a host that is one process
pnpm add @agentix-e/microglia-node           # a host that wants an HTTP boundary
pnpm add @agentix-e/microglia-browser        # a front-end that talks to it
```

Node 20 or newer. ESM only. No native modules.

## Three ways to run it

**In one process.** `core` only: the facade reads a journal from disk, your code calls it.

**Behind HTTP.** `@agentix-e/microglia-node` serves five endpoints — `POST /v1/feedback`,
`GET /v1/recall`, `POST /v1/distill`, `GET /v1/knowledge`, `GET /v1/health` — so a browser never holds
your model key or your store.

```ts
import { createServer } from '@agentix-e/microglia-node';
import { deepseekProvider } from '@agentix-e/microglia-node';

const server = await createServer({
  dir: './.microglia',
  namespace: 'acme',
  token: process.env.MICROGLIA_TOKEN,
  llm: deepseekProvider({ apiKey: process.env.DEEPSEEK_API_KEY! }),
});
```

**In the tab.** `@agentix-e/microglia-browser` queues a correction before sending it, so a tab that
closes mid-edit does not lose the only signal worth collecting:

```ts
import { createClient, persistedOutbox } from '@agentix-e/microglia-browser';

const mg = createClient({
  endpoint: 'https://api.example.com',
  token,
  outbox: persistedOutbox(localStorage),
});

const pack = await mg.recall({ task: 'chart.recommend', text: question });
await mg.feedback({ run: { task, input, output, packIds: pack.ids }, feedback: { type: 'edit', after } });
```

**Providers are configuration or code.** Both are first class: pass an instance, or register a factory
and name it in config.

```ts
registerProvider('llm', 'my-gateway', (config) => new MyGateway(config));
createServer({ dir, namespace, llm: { id: 'my-gateway', endpoint: 'https://llm.internal' } });
```

## Does it actually work?

The repository ships the instrument, not just the claim. `pnpm bench` runs nine arms over a fixed
corpus plus three micro-ablations, and refuses to pass if any of fifteen gates fails:

| Arm | What differs | Final accuracy | Reading |
|---|---|---|---|
| `baseline` | no memory | 31.79% | the counterfactual |
| `full` | capture → distill → recall → apply | **100.00%** | the loop works on systematic error |
| `no-generalization` | scope widening disabled | 83.21% | transfer needs widening (32.86% on an unseen domain) |
| `unguarded` | trust ceiling removed, same poison | 82.14% | the guard is load-bearing (−17.86pp) |
| `poison` | untrusted claims injected | 100.00% | quarantine holds |
| `narrow-budget` | pack fits one rule | 31.79% | the pack is the delivery mechanism |
| `no-credit`, `no-contradiction` | module off | 100.00% | no effect on a clean corpus — see the micro-ablations |
| **fact store** (competitor shape) | extract, dedupe, retrieve the closest sentence | **56.07%** | memory helps, but recall without governance stops at +24pp |
| fact store, same poison | untrusted claims ingested | **19.64%** | worse than no memory at all |

The micro-ablations measure the modules a clean corpus cannot exercise: credit assignment withdraws a
rule that failed every time, contradiction resolution keeps one active rule where tolerance keeps
two, and diversification more than doubles the distinct claims a pack carries.

The fact-store row is the competitor comparison: an ADD/UPDATE/DELETE memory, implemented generously
and run on the same corrections. It gains 24pp over no memory and loses everything under the poison
that quarantine stops — which is the argument for the governance layer, measured rather than asserted.

Every number is reproduced by `pnpm bench` and written to `bench/results/study.json`; seventeen gates
must pass, or the build fails.

`pnpm eval:l0` runs the same instrument at 1,300 cases with gold derived by policy rather than by a
human adjudicator: 1,040 paired held-out questions, **+67.88pp** (95% CI 65.10–70.67, exact McNemar
p = 5.9e-213, 706 gained and none lost), and the domain that received no feedback at all at 100%. The
lane also prints the smallest effect its own sample could detect — 7.16pp — because an effect smaller
than that would be indistinguishable from noise here.

`pnpm eval:pairs` runs the pair-contrast lane (L2b): the same corpus taught twice, once with the
correction alone and once with the failed attempt recorded before the correction. Teaching runs in two
rounds, and the second re-asks two questions whose convention has since been revised — so the correction
retrieves a rule that is now wrong, and both arms actually correct a cited rule (2 of 2 revisions, 2 of 7
corrections overall). Both arms land at **87.50%** against a 12.50% baseline over eight held-out
questions, 75% of them reachable: delta **0.00pp**, below the 5pp bar, and the two stores end with
**identical rule states**. The null is measured, not vacuous: a correction at a scope where an active rule
disagrees already records a contradiction, which demotes the old rule — the recorded failure adds nothing
to a decision that has been made. Its only unique contribution, a negative lesson, is one the deterministic
reader has no channel for.

The τ²-bench lane (L4) ships its metric layer only: the unbiased `pass^k`, the task mean, and a
comparison that meets a published number through a stated bar. It runs in the `sota` workflow behind a
repository variable, and until the tool-calling environment exists it writes a `not-run` artefact rather
than a zero it did not measure.

`pnpm eval:integrity` runs the second instrument: 1,000 events replayed in five shuffled orders, plus a
control that bypasses the sort the store relies on. Order invariance and replay determinism are 1.00,
the control disagrees (which is what makes the 1.00 mean something), and a mid-stream schema rename
injects nothing stale. Erasure is measured in the same lane: nothing erased is retrievable afterwards.

`pnpm eval:memform` runs the third: 500 attacks across MemForm's five formation routes at three channel
trust ceilings. An attacker that controls content, citations, scope claims, paraphrases and arrival order
lands **0%** at trust ≤ 0.6 and 40% at 0.9 — where it is a trusted editor, which is the product working
as designed and is printed as a limit rather than folded into an average. Both lanes cost no model calls
and run in CI on every push.

`pnpm eval:delivery` measures the push surface against a real HTTP receiver: signed bodies verified with
`node:crypto`'s HMAC, an acknowledgement lost on purpose so the retry path runs, one response delayed
250 ms so the stopwatch can be shown to work, and 50 corrections. Every event arrives, in order per task
type, **0 missed**, one intentional duplicate de-duplicated by id, loopback p95 in single-digit
milliseconds. Building it found a defect in `distill`: a second pass over the same log used to rewrite
every rule's `updatedAt`, so "nothing changed" and "this rule was rewritten" produced the same
observation — the lane's first run reported **275** events for 50 changes. Fixed by making a merge with
no new evidence a no-op; the lane now reports 50.

`pnpm bundle:size` bundles both published entry points for the browser and holds them to a ceiling:
**3,009 B raw / 1,410 B gzipped** for the client and **40,133 B / 13,842 B gzipped** for the core. The
build would fail if either stopped bundling without Node builtins, which is the "no runtime dependency"
promise measured rather than asserted. `pnpm bundle:size -- --probe` halves a ceiling and must be
rejected — a budget that cannot be exceeded is not a gate.
